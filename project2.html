      <h2>PROJECT II.</h2>
      <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p class="fade-in">
        This summer, I participated in an internship with Engineering Good (EG), a non-profit based in Singapore. I worked at their office in Singapore on two projects: a Service Allocation System for volunteers and automating their Notion database workflow. I worked closely with Engineering Good's Laptop Fixers Community team to design a system they could use to keep track of and allocate laptop service requests to their volunteers. After creating a new system for them to use, I worked with another intern to write automations for EG's Notion workflow using the Google and Notion API.

      <h4><b>PROJECT I: LAPTOP SERVICE SYSTEM</b></h4>
      <p class="fade-in">
        One initiative of Engineering Good (EG) is digital inclusion. Beneficiaries of Engineering Good can bring their faulty laptops in for troubleshooting at EG's Repair Clinics. The Laptop Fixers Community team needed a system that consolidates related data, automates processes, and integrates with EG's Notion workspace
      </p>
      <img src="app/images/beneficiary-form.png" class="project-image fade-in border">
      <p class="fade-in">
        The first part of the system I created was the Beneficiary Form. This Google Form is what is sent out to the beneficiaries. It collects information about the individual as well as the laptop(s) that they need fixed. This Google Form automatically populated an accompanying Google Sheet. Attached to this sheet was the JavaScript code that I wrote and hosted and Google Apps Script.
      </p>
      <img src="app/images/script-sheet.png" class="project-image fade-in border">
      <p class="fade-in">
        This script automates the adding of appointment slots to the Beneficiary Form, allows for the limiting of the number of people who can sign up for a single appointment, and automates email notifications.
      </p>
      <p class="fade-in">
        After that, I focused on creating an accompanying Notion workspace. I will not go into much detail about how the workspace was organized, but if you wish to learn more, you can find my presentation on this project below (under Part 1).
      </p>

      <p class="fade-in">
        The system I created improved the efficiency of the Laptop Fixers' workflow by digitizing their laptop service system (which used to be done on paper), consolidating all related data into one Notion workspace, automating processes (such as data entry and email notifications), and providing the Laptop Fixers with customization options. I also left EG with very thorough documentation on the project as well as a sandbox system that allows the Laptop Fixers to experiment with the workspace without breaking the original.
