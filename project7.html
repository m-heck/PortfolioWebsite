      <h2>PROJECT VII.</h2>
      <h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4>
      <p class="fade-in">
        My JSA website was my first big web development project (after a mini rock-paper-scissors project I made earlier). I designed the website for the University of Florida's new Japanese Student Association (JSA). Click the button below to visit the website:

      <h4><b>THE PROCESS</b></h4>
      <p class="fade-in">
        The project started out as just a general single-page website where I could experiment with my newly acquired knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted it to be clean and pretty- a sandbox so I can test out different ideas I had as I was working through web development tutorials.
      </p>
      <p class="fade-in">
        During the time I was developing this website, I was still brand new to web development. Every single step of the way, I was always following tutorials, Googling solutions, and just learning things in general. This made the process very slow and tedious because each element on the website took a tremendous amount of time for me to figure out how to do. Even things as simple as the navigation bar and laying out website elements symmetrically was difficult for me. This website was a grind.
      </p>
      <p class="fade-in">
        Slowly, however, it started coming together. I think what really makes this website pop is the top of its homepage, which features parallax scrolling effects.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-in">
        I also discovered how much effort goes into making a website, something I hadn't put much thought into before. For example, I had to make sure every single asset I used was free for commercial use, I had to make different layouts for people with different devices, and I had to make sure all the webpage elements would show up correctly across different browsers.
      </p>
      <p class="fade-in">
        Although the website hasn't been populated with data for the Japanese Student Association yet, I am content with the state its in now. It was definitely a gigantic step in my web development career- one where I tearned my self-learning efforts into a real product.
